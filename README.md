## Hackathons

| July 2024 - Proud Coders     | I participated in the Code Institute Hackathon themed around the LGBTQ community. Tasked with identifying and contributing to the resolution of a real world problem faced by the community. We were randomly assigned to groups of between 4 and 6 individuals in size. My team and I decided to focus on addressing some of the misconceptions often faced by members of the community and the history of the community. Alongside this we also developed a small interactive quiz for users to test their knowledge after reading the educational material on the site.

| August 2024 - Pixel Pioneers | Another hackathon organised by Code Institute, this time themed around retro games. My team and I decided to make a duck hunt inspire arcade click shooter. This was a great experience for me as I got to dive in and explore the Canvas element in much greater details than I had before. We had several game features that had to be removed from the final product as we began to realise the scope of what was involved in such a short time frame but I still thoroughly enjoyed the experience of working with my team.
